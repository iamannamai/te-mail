# TE-MAIL

An email templating service built in React and NodeJS

## FEATURES/HOW TO

- User can provide an email template with keys denoted by `%%key_name%%` and generate key inputs by clicking on `Commit Template`
- User can provide values for keys and then click `Preview` to request a preview from server
- User can `Send Email` if all fields are provided
- User is warned if their template changes from the template they generated their keys with
- User is told whether their email sent successfully or not

## GETTING STARTED

### Production

- `npm start` - creates client bundle and starts the server

### Development

To run the program locally, you will need to provide a `.env` file containing a SendGrid API key into the root folder. Specifically, create a `.env` file and add `SENDGRID_API_KEY=<SG_KEY>`

- `npm run start-dev` - builds client, starts server, watches for changes on both for auto-reload during development
- `npm test` - execute all tests (client and server)

## TODOS/WORKAROUNDS

### Client

[ ] Regex to generate keys is currently only looking for `<keyName>%%` instead of `%%<keyName>%%`. Need to correct.
[ ] App maintains a `template` and `editedTemplate` state. Can we consolidate these?
[ ] Used `dangerouslySetHtml` property on client to render html from server for email preview. React advises against this practice, but the html is rendered by handlebars in our requests.

### Server

[ ] Fault Tolerance - set up an app instance in server to listen to server failures and restart server if needed
[ ] Key identification in server depends on providing an input body with the matching keys provided. i.e. if template is `template with %%key1%%` and the input body doesn't contain key, the template returned would be `<div>template with key1</div>` instead of `<div>template with {{key1}}</div>`
